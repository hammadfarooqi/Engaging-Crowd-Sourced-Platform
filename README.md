## Features

- **Text Display:** A scrollable display for the article content that is parsed and autoseparated into sections is displayed on the left.
- **Quiz Display:** One multiple choice question chosen from the article's question bank is displayed on the right, and after the user answers, they are provided instant audio and visual feedback and a new question.
- **Formative Assessment:** As the user progresses through the multiple choice questions, Interactpedia uses its built-in algorithm to choose questions for the user about topics they struggle with.
- **Cognitive Scaffolding Hints:** If the reader are stuck on one question, they can click the hint button that points them to where they can find the answer.
